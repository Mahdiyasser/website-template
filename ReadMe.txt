!this is the template that my website is based on! if you aren't a web-dev you must read this file
if you liked my website (mahdiyasser.site) well lucky you why? bcasue my website is FOSS (free open source software)
so you can just copy paste and edit it to match your vision but keep on mind readind the MIT license first
ok this was my intro now lets get into the real reason you must read this file also iam egyption so english isn't my 1st language so my grammer isn't the best keep that in mind.
this file is you guide to make your own portfolio website with an integrated Blog yes Blog
its not like facebook or anything but its a blog and it looks great only problem with it is that you have to manually make a html file for each post
but dont worry i made a template file that you just copy paste and edit it then voila also for the posts to show up  on the blog you have to edit the posts.json file
but also its not hard the file already exicst and it alrady have a post so you look at it and learn from it and also i forgot to tell you that the post iam talking about is in the blog
you will have to delete it yourself but its just a file so its easy and that was the blog but i also have another thing that once you understand the blog it will be so easy also 
what is it ? its a projects section its basicly a blog and inside it there is other blogs so lets say it in simpler words
the projects section is like the blog but insted of posts it have projects each project is a blog inside it there is posts 
why did i do it ? so when i have the abilty to organise my posts so if i have like a "project" i have all my posts there so its easy for the reader to keep up
now we finshed the 2 things i consider the most important features in my website but now lets talk about the website itself
the website's features are 
1- 2 css layouts so if you open the site on a pc or mobile you have the perfect layout always but let me clarify how it works
there is a javascript file that load 1 css file from the 2 based on 2 things the wedith and height if the wedith is bigger than the height it will load the pc version
and if its the oppiste it will load the mobile version and yes if you rotate your phone it will load the pc version and if your pc screen is put in portrait and not landscape it will load the mobile version 
i think you got the point 
2- the website have 4 socialmedia buttons that can easily be edited you can change the picture and name and link you can make it link to anything because its just a link after all
3- the website have 3 cards that link to any link or directory you want if its in the site but for my use case these 3 cards point to 3 my servers out the website and you can edit the images and the overlay text easily 
and also there is 2 cards that i use to point to the blog and the projects section as i said you can edit like you want but i dont recomind editing them unless you wont use the blog or the projects sectionot both 
4- there is a pfp picture and 2 othere images under the description those 2 images look like cards in the mobile version but slightly bigger 
5- there is a description card-like part and under that description there is another hidden one in the html file you can uncomment it to use it as you like i suggest using it for stuff like announcements because it was made for announcements
6- there is built-in metas in the head of the main index file that will make your site appear super fast on GSC if you send a request that only takes minutes but you must edit the metas because they are set to me so you have to look at them and edit them and
if you dont think you can do it you can just call a friend or use chatgpt 
and thats it i also dont recomind editing the files that are css or js because it might ruin your site and also i strongly recomind only editing the stuff that was made to be edited and thats it this all you need to make you own website with a blog and a projects section
i also strongly suggest using chatgpt if you have 0 experinse in html and meta tags thats it for non devolpers and if you love this website follow me on github (https://github.com/Mahdiyasesr).
