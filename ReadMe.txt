Welcome to My Website Template

This is the template my website (https://mahdiyasser.site) is built on. If you aren’t a web dev, you must read this.

If you liked my website — lucky you! It’s FOSS (Free Open Source Software), so you can copy, paste, and edit it to match your own vision. Just make sure you check the MIT license first.

Also, heads up — English isn’t my first language, so forgive my grammar here and there.

What This README Is For

This file is your guide to creating your own portfolio website with an integrated Blog. Not like Facebook or anything — just a blog, but it looks clean and works well.

Heads up: each blog post requires a manual HTML file. Don’t stress — I made a template you can copy, paste, and edit. To show posts on your blog, you also need to update the posts.json file. The file already has an example post, so you can learn from it. Delete it when you want — it’s easy or you can just use the CMS its explained down there.

Projects Section

Once you get the blog, the Projects section is easy. Here’s how it works:

It’s basically a blog but for projects.

Each project is like its own mini-blog, containing posts.

Why? To keep your posts organized under projects so readers can follow along easily.

Website Features

Responsive CSS Layouts

There are 2 CSS layouts: PC and mobile.

A JavaScript file automatically loads the correct layout based on screen width vs. height.

Rotate your phone? The layout updates. Put your PC screen in portrait? Same thing.

Social Media Buttons

4 buttons. Change icons, names, or links easily. Link them anywhere — they’re just links.

Cards

3 main cards for any links or directories you want (mine point to my servers).

2 extra cards for the blog and projects section (you can edit them, but I don’t recommend it unless you’re not using those sections).

Images

Profile picture + 2 extra images below the description.

On mobile, those 2 images act like slightly bigger cards.

Description Cards

Main description card.

Hidden secondary card in HTML for announcements or extra info — just uncomment it to use.

Built-In Meta Tags

Preloaded in the <head> for faster indexing on Google Search Console.

Update them to fit your info. Don’t worry if you’re unsure — ask a friend or use ChatGPT.

Tips for Non-Developers

Only edit the parts meant to be edited (text, images, links).

Avoid touching CSS or JS unless you know what you’re doing — it can break your site.

If you have zero experience with HTML or meta tags, ChatGPT is your friend.

For Developers

If you’re a dev, do your thing. Ignore most of this, except maybe the “follow me” part.

CMS (Optional)

I added a GUI-based CMS for blog posts.

Access it like this: https://yourdomain.moc/blog/cms.

Makes creating posts way easier than manual HTML editing.
